# MOD-M
The aim of the Multilayered Omics Data Modeling (MOD-M) project is to provide a computational core for the creation of multidimensional causal models, to evaluate the molecular underpinnings of homeostatic processes perturbation. The concept of perturbation arises when a system is altered (i.e., changed) by one or more external influences affecting its behavior respect to a reference state (often described as physiological or healthy). The ultimate goal of the MOD-M project is to provide a scalable statistical learning framework for generating data-driven models, enabling the detection of perturbation drivers within their molecular context, under different exogenous stimuli and experimental conditions.
